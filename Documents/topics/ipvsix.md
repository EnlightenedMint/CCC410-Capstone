# IPV6 attacks on IPV4
> The idea is to research how IPv4 can be compromised via IPv6 on Windows systems. Then some VMs will be set up to demonstrate the methods found.

### Why?
IPv6 at the moment is not widely implemented and there is not much written about it on the ways it can be used to attack systems. Every Windows system by default since Vista has IPv6 enabled by default and is set to be preffered over IPv4, meaning it could be an attack vector that is unaccounted for.
This Project will allow me to exercise research, system administration, and security skills to find and test lesser known attacks.
