# Ransomware defense for small organizations
> White paper written intended for small organizations such as non-profits, schools, small businesses, etc. Paper will involve research into ransomware methods, top ransomware in use recently, and effective measures to consider with small organizations in mind. 

### Why?
Small organizations often lack appropriate measures to tackle cyber attacks such as ransomware attacks. This leads to organizations not being left with many choices but to pay the ransom. 
This project will allow me to exercise my research, system administration, and security skills while using limited resources to develop policies and countermeasures for one of the growing cyber attack methods.
